The Coming Soon modules *allows you to add a "coming soon" page* to 
your website, with a *fully responsive template*, that can be easily *customize* 
to fit your needs.

It also provides a *subscription system* for your visitors, so you can 
*collect your guests emails* to notify them later when the website is live.

This module keeps the *user login page accessible*, so *admins can log in* 
and keep working on the site freely. While all other 
*anonymous visitors will be redirected to the "coming soon" page* as long 
as the "end date" - which is configurable in the back office 
- has not expired yet. Which makes this module very useful when you are 
*working on your content but does not want the site to be public* or
*in maintenance mode* either.
